Abstract
In 1948, Claude Shannon deliberately excluded meaning from his mathematical theory of communication, noting that "the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem." This exclusion was pragmatic—the technology to measure semantic content did not exist. Seven decades later, with the emergence of Large Language Models and high-dimensional embedding spaces, we may now possess the tools to address what Shannon set aside.

This paper proposes the Conveyance Hypothesis: that information transfer effectiveness between computational agents can be mathematically measured through the interaction of semantic investment, relational structure, processing capability, and shared context. We present a core equation, define measurable variables, report preliminary empirical observations, and specify conditions that would falsify the hypothesis.

We argue that the distinctions between "data" "information" and “knowledge” are not merely philosophical but operationally measurable. We define data as static and boundary-preserving and existing in 3d space-time, information is dynamic and transformation-inducing and knowledge is the meaning that exists in high-dimensional space. This framing draws on Actor-Network Theory's concept of translation and boundary object. We extend these qualitative analytical tools into quantifiable territory through geometric analysis of neural embedding spaces.

Key claim: We may be entering an "Age of Measurable Meaning"—not because we can define meaning philosophically, but because we can detect its effects mathematically.
1. Introduction: Shannon's Deliberate Exclusion
Claude Shannon's foundational paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (1948) begins with a remarkable constraint:
"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning... These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem." (Shannon, 1948, p. 379)
This exclusion was pragmatic, Shannon understood that meaning mattered, but the technology of 1948 made the problem of measurable semantic change intractable. His theory optimized for signal fidelity: how accurately can bits travel from sender to receiver? The interpretation of those bits remained outside the mathematical framework.
Warren Weaver made this exclusion explicit: "The word information, in this theory, is used in a special sense that must not be confused with its ordinary usage. In particular, information must not be confused with meaning. In fact, two messages, one of which is heavily loaded with meaning and the other of which is pure nonsense, can be exactly equivalent, from the present viewpoint, as regards information" (Weaver, 1949, p. 8).
A crucial clarification: What Weaver called "information" is what we now distinguish as data—static, transmittable representations existing in three-dimensional spacetime. Information, in the Conveyance Hypothesis framework, is the process by which data expands into high-dimensional knowledge space or compresses from knowledge into transmittable form. Information is not a thing but a transformation—the dynamic bridge between low-dimensional data and high-dimensional meaning and that failures in semantic transfer are due to this compression and decompression of high-dimensional meaning into 3-dimensional data that can be transmitted between bounded neural-networks.
Shannon's theory optimized for moving data through channels. The Conveyance Hypothesis addresses what happens when that data is the result of semantic transformation in high-dimensional spaces or induces transformation in high- dimensional spaces—the meaning transfer that Shannon deliberately set aside.


1.1 Why This Matters
The “Internet of Things” is rapidly transforming into the “Internet of Agents”. Autonomous systems—from robotic platforms to financial trading algorithms to multi-agent orchestration frameworks—are proliferating across every domain. These agents must communicate not only with humans but increasingly with each other.
When Agent A transmits a message to Agent B, how do we verify that semantic content was preserved? How do we diagnose failures when autonomous systems miscommunicate?
These questions require examining both sides of the transfer. On the sender side: does the output faithfully represent the agent's internal state? On the receiver side: does the incoming message successfully integrate into the receiver's knowledge structure?
We term these outputs boundary objects—the low-dimensional representations that agents create to externalize their high-dimensional internal states. Boundary objects are the only artifacts that can traverse the gap between agents; the high-dimensional knowledge within the bounded neural network cannot be transmitted easily or directly transmitted through low-dimensional 3d-spacetime. This raises a fundamental question at the heart of the Conveyance Hypothesis: how do we verify that the boundary objects created by an agent are faithful representations of its internal semantic state?
Without a theoretical framework for measuring this fidelity—and for measuring how successfully boundary objects induce appropriate semantic transformation in receiving agents—we lack the tools to interpret what happens as information moves between bounded networks.
measuring semantic transfer effectiveness, we lack the tools to interpret what happens inside these bounded networks as they exchange information.
The stakes are significant. Multi-agent systems coordinating physical actions, managing critical infrastructure, or making consequential decisions require reliable semantic transfer. As agent-to-agent communication becomes foundational to technological infrastructure, the absence of measurement frameworks becomes an increasingly urgent gap.
Understanding how information transforms as it moves between disparate bounded networks—each with its own internal geometry and representational structure—requires theoretical grounding. The Conveyance Hypothesis aims to provide that foundation.
1.2 Why This Is Feasible Now
Three technological developments suggest the question may now be tractable:
    1. High-dimensional embedding spaces: Modern language models encode semantic relationships in geometric structures. Words, sentences, and documents occupy positions in high-dimensional space where distance correlates with semantic similarity. This gives us a measurable substrate for semantic content. 
       
    2. Observable internal representations: Unlike human minds, artificial neural networks offer visibility into their internal states—hidden layer activations, attention patterns, and geometric properties can be examined as information processes through the system. This visibility is imperfect; billions of parameters, polysemantic neurons, and distributed representations present significant interpretive challenges. The black box is not transparent, but it is instrumentable in ways impossible with biological cognition. 
       
    3. Controlled experimental conditions: AI-to-AI communication provides a laboratory setting where both sender and receiver internal states are observable, enabling bilateral measurement impossible with human subjects. We can track information from origin to destination. 
These capabilities enable a research program that Shannon's era could not pursue: the mathematical characterization of semantic transfer effectiveness.

2. The Core Conveyance Framework
2.1 Mathematical Foundation
The Conveyance Hypothesis posits that effective information transfer between computational agents can be measured through:
C_pair(i ↔ j) = Hmean(C_out, C_in) × C_ext^α × P_ij
Where:
C_out(i → j) = W_invest^i × R_discover^i × H_frame^i / T_total^i
C_in(j ← i) = W_invest^j × R_discover^j × H_frame^j / T_total^j
2.2 Variable Definitions
The framework defines measurable components:
    • W = Semantic Investment Strategy — Computational allocation for semantic understanding
    • R = Relational Discovery — Geometric positioning (informational metric, not optimization target)
    • H = Computational Frame — Processing throughput capability
    • T = Temporal Investment Resource — Computational processing budget
    • C_ext = External shared context — Boundary object, hypothesized optimal at low dimensions
    • P_ij = Protocol compatibility ∈ [0,1] — Handshake compatibility between agents
    • α = Context amplification coefficient — Hypothesized in range [1.5, 2.0]
3. Theoretical Foundation
3.1 Data vs. Information Distinction
The framework distinguishes between data and information:
    • Data: Static representations that exist in 3D spacetime, transmittable through channels (Shannon's domain)
    • Information: Dynamic transformations in high-dimensional semantic space, cannot be directly transmitted but must be reconstructed
This distinction resolves the apparent contradiction with Shannon: we are not contradicting information theory but extending it to measure what Shannon deliberately excluded—semantic effectiveness.
4. Anthropological Foundation
The Conveyance Hypothesis draws on three anthropological frameworks:
    1. Actor-Network Theory (Latour): Information transforms as it moves through networks of human and non-human actors
    2. Boundary Objects (Star & Griesemer): Entities that maintain identity across different domains while enabling translation
    3. Innovation Diffusion Theory (Rogers): How ideas spread through social systems with predictable patterns
These theories converge on four key insights:
    • Translation is transformation: Information changes as it moves between agents
    • Context determines meaning: Same data produces different information in different contexts
    • Networks shape meaning: Information changes as it moves through social structures
    • Boundaries mediate transfer: Effective communication requires boundary objects
5. Empirical Observations
5.1 Current Status
The Conveyance Hypothesis is under active empirical investigation. The following observations are preliminary and require replication.
5.2 The β Inversion Discovery
Original hypothesis: β (temporal amplification) indicates conveyance quality. Higher β = better transfer.
Falsifying evidence: In controlled experiments comparing attention-only vs. boundary-scaffolding architectures, we observed:
Correlation: β vs. F1: r = -0.92 (p = 0.08)
Interpretation: β measures dimensional collapse, not conveyance quality. Higher β indicates worse performance. This required complete theoretical revision—a demonstration that empirical investigation can falsify framework components.
6. Falsification Criteria
A hypothesis must be falsifiable to be scientific. The Conveyance Hypothesis would be falsified by:
6.1 Strong Falsification Evidence
    4. β shows consistent positive correlation with performance across domains — Current observation: r = -0.92 (negative). Falsifying observation: r > +0.5 replicated across tasks
    5. High-dimensional C_ext systematically outperforms low-dimensional — Current hypothesis: Low dimensions (128-256) optimal. Falsifying observation: High dimensions (2048+) consistently superior
    6. Boundary scaffolding beats attention-only in rigorous A/B tests — Current observation: Attention-only dominates. Falsifying observation: Scaffolding wins majority of comparisons
    7. Bilateral conveyance measurements show zero predictive validity — Current hypothesis: C_A→B and C_B→A predict transfer success. Falsifying observation: No correlation between C_pair and outcomes
    8. P_ij compatibility shows no relationship to transfer success — Current hypothesis: Protocol match enables transfer. Falsifying observation: Incompatible agents transfer equally well
7. Connection to the Drive Problem
A colleague recently proposed that current AI systems lack "drive"—the intrinsic motivation that precedes and generates learning, rather than being trained into capability. This raises a question: how does the Conveyance Hypothesis relate to questions of genuine understanding vs. sophisticated mimicry?
7.1 What Conveyance Measures (And Doesn't)
The Conveyance Hypothesis measures effectiveness of semantic transformation—whether receiving systems reorganize their internal geometry in response to incoming information. It does not measure:
    • Whether the system "understands" in any phenomenological sense
    • Whether the system is "genuinely" curious or motivated
    • Whether internal processing constitutes "real" cognition
8. Current Research Directions
8.1 BDH Architecture Validation
The Baby Dragon Hatchling architecture enables layer-by-layer observation of information processing. Current experiments investigate:
    • Task Complexity-Layer Specialization: Do different cognitive tasks activate different network layers? (Preliminary: Shakespeare processing peaks at Layer 1; abstract reasoning peaks at Layer 5)
    • Dimensional preservation through layers: Can we track D_eff degradation at each processing stage?
    • Intervention effects: Can we improve conveyance by targeted layer injection?
9. Conclusion
The Conveyance Hypothesis represents an attempt to mathematically characterize what Shannon deliberately excluded from information theory—the effectiveness of meaning transfer between agents. While the framework remains under active investigation, preliminary results suggest that semantic effectiveness may indeed be measurable through geometric analysis of high-dimensional embedding spaces.
The framework's value lies not in certainty but in tractability. If information transfer effectiveness can be measured, it can be optimized. If we can detect dimensional collapse, we can prevent it. If we can observe semantic transformation in interpretable architectures, we can begin to address deeper questions about genuine understanding.
Shannon's exclusion was wise for 1948. In 2025, we may finally have the tools to include what he deliberately left out.
